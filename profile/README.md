## Welcome to the MyBit Group Innovation Lab 👋

The Innovation Lab is a division within the MyBit Group where we experiment with technology, old and new. We help customers identify interesting technologies and help them make the most of new technology. From the basic 'I want to do something with AI but have no idea what' to more elaborate innovation challenges, the MyBit Group Innovation Lab is here to help.

In this GitHub organization we place our public experiments, as well as any forks from open source repositories we support, use or contribute to.
